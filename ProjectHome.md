Mastermind is a simple game engine to create a game. With this library, all you have to worry is the user interface, because all the hard work is already done!

The benefits of using this library:
  * All you need is to work on the GUI (or CLI !)
  * Complete engine for the 3 Mastermind levels (4, 5 and 6 colors) + custom game levels, for single player (2 players planned!)
  * Scores per game and global
  * Easy game integration (use a sequential paradigm for your application; events are planned!)
  * Small footprint (under 50 KB compiled DLL)

Feel free to download the library and check the source!
