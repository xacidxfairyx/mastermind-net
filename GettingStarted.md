# Introduction #

The class was written with the intention of hiding as much game logic from the developer as possible, to allow him/her creating the GUI/CLI, instead of focusing on game details.

Also, for developers who want to create a Mastermind game from scratch, but don't want to worry using dozen of classes. All the public classes were reduced to the following:

  * Mastermind: it's a factory and allows you to create the needed objects to interact with the system
  * MastermindGame: where the action happens! This class represents a game, and allows you to simulate a board. All the moves are done internally, and the final result is returned after that
  * ScoreCard: allows you to save score from all games you wish to save. Later, the scores can be retrieved as a global score from all games, or search for a individual game, and get the score

Enumerators were designed to be informative as well. Descriptive names and rich documentation descriptions makes easier to developer to know what each option does.

# Example code #

```
// Creates a new custom game, with human and computer as players
// Board has 6 rows, allowing 2 pegs per row
MastermindGame mm = Mastermind.createCustomGame("human", "computer", 6, 2);

// Creates the secret combination to be guessed by human player
PegColor[] colors = new PegColor[] { PegColor.Blue, PegColor.Cyan };
ColoredPegRow combination = Mastermind.createCombination(colors);
mm.setup(combination);

// The setup is done, we can start the game
mm.startGame();

while (mm.Status == GameStatus.Running)
{
  // Note that getUserGuess must be implemented by the developer
  // It must return the user guess for the current move
  ColoredPegRow userGuess = getUserGuess();

  // MoveResult can give you information like how many pegs had the right color or were in the correct position
  MoveResult mr = mm.doMove(e.Current);
}

// Outside the loop, means the game already ended
if (mm.Status == GameStatus.Ended)
  MsgBox("game ended!");

```

When the game ends, it's not possible to do more moves, but there is a lot of information that MastermindGame classe can still provide, such as:
  * Time statistics
  * The winner of this match
  * Save the players victory in the ScoreCard
